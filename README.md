# QuickBaloon

QuickBaloon is an application made in Java that uses only OpenSource libraries currently in Beta version.
The project was born with the idea of Maris Casamenti, the implementation of the software was 
made by Dario Grandi.

It is a software procedure developed on the skills of quality and metrolgy experts.
Designed to significantly accelerate the highlighting phase of the dimensions on drawings 2d. and to facilitate the subsequent dimensional survey phase of the metrological quotas.
The more than twenty-five years of development staff skills have allowed us to implement a product that considerably shortens, estimated up to a tenth, the time required to carry out the same operation by hand.
Quick balloon is a software procedure to be used in an industrial environment in the metrology sector, in particular during the preparation of the technical documentation to be used for dimensional measurements, it has been designed to optimize resources and minimize the significant costs of dimensional dimensions.
Automatically opens the .jpg, .pdf and .dxf formats allowing a quick and precise identification of the dimensions.
Subsequently the quotas can be shown on their own format or on other applications.
Allows the selection of some types of identifying callouts and different colors; moreover, in case of error of identification of a quota, to eliminate the reference without having to repeat the whole process.
Drawing 2d, once the quotas have been identified, can be saved in the .jpg and .pdf formats for a convenient filing and subsequent sending by email, avoiding expensive and cumbersome copies on paper difficult to store and use.
The main success factor of Quick baloon, however, remains the drastic reduction in the time required to perform the 2D drawing dimension activity.
When you need to prepare a dimensional report of a piece for third parties or for your activities you need to be efficient at all stages of your process, Quick baloon helps you to considerably reduce the highlighting phase of the shares, allowing you to create a quick and clean work.
